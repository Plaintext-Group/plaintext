description: "What is the internet, where did it come from, and where is it going?
You have a mission. To invent the new inter-web. We explore Web1.0, 2.0 & 3.0 and put digital applications in context to understand the values applied to technology as we explore how and why the internet came about, emerging technologies that challenge existing concerns with technology, including blockchain, and how to found and grow your own technology startup. We then apply this understanding to think about the possible futures of the internet and your role in helping design and build this."

# Title & Overview
The promise of the internet: The invention and evolution of the internet, with an emphasis on the competition of values and priorities between opensource and proprietary software, and the monetization of user data. (Components of the internet, focusing on software. We’ll come back to protocols, hardware & people).

# Knowledge
Opensource mindset. The origins and values of the internet and opensource technology.

# Skills
Critical analysis, research, public speaking presentation.

# Activities:
1.	In groups of 3, what are 4 things when you hear the word internet, that come to mind? What is most important and most obvious?
(Feedback to group. Post-it notes on wall).
Promise of the internet. Why was it developed in the first place (quote). What was in the mind of the inventors? (See internet society, W3C, Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_web_browser, https://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/02/16/ways-people-described-computers-1990s-hilarious/)
2.	Present information: what is each item on the timeline? (https://www.tes.com/lessons/hMm6KQB3x9wzPw/web-the-history-of-the-internet. Instructor to explain definition, purpose and inventor of one’s they don’t know. Provide quotes by inventors. Understand layers: protocol, web browser, search engine, web app, app. Content consumption (information access) and content creation (blog, video, real-time shared applications).
3.	Understanding software business models (open-source versus proprietary). Case study of each: Facebook & Wikipedia.  Google maps & Openmaps.
4.	Understand self as a user of the internet and digital identity of a way you present. Technology analysis. What to you use, how does it work, what data information is being created and who ‘owns’ the data.
5.	Metaphorically “Google” yourself. What apps do you use? What data is shared? Who is your digital self, what information is available and how can you manage what’s online about yourself?
6.	Applied algorithms case study: research a company and how their data algorithms work. Based on your learnings of what’s possible, what are some algorithms you could create if you had a company? Present back to the class.
