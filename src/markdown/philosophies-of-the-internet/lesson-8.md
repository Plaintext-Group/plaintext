# Title & Overview
What are we built on? It all begins with (open)hardware. Open-source design in the physical world through hardware. 
# Knowledge
What can be discovered when we look at the built environment around us and realise that we can design, build and re-purpose…anything? We’ll take a look at open hardware designs and then design your very own that you would want to build which is open source but can be built to exist in the physical world around us. 
Moving back down the technology stack to understand and interact with ‘slow hardware’ – simple, rebuildable, re-purposeable technology that the user controls. 
Understanding how the internet that we see and interact with is layers upon layers of abstraction and creating opportunity to interact with any or all of these layers.
# Skills
Hardware design, networking, problem solving, creativity, research, presentation.
# Activities:
1. Find a hardware template on an opensource code repository and find out what it would take to build it.
2. Case study: the open-source computer stand, invented by a University student. Activity: Pick an everyday object and outline how you would design and share it as an open-source template in a written proposal. 
3. Share in small groups.
# Materials:
Computer and internet.
# Optional text:
Openism (non-fiction book or pdf).
